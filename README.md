## General info
Learning what is a queue. A simple program with a main menu allows to choose useful functions demonstrating what a queue is, how it works and how to interact with it: `pop(), push(), size(), empty()`.
* `push()` - adds an element at the end of the queue
* `pop()` - deletes an element from the beginning of the queue
* `size()` - shows how many elements there are currently in the queue
* `empty()` - shows if the queue is empty

## Technologies
* C++
* CodeBlocks (IDE)
* GNU GCC Compiler (minGW)
